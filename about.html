    <h2 class="utcenter">History of our locations</h2>
    <h3>Our Journey Began in Leeds</h3>
    <p> In the heart of Leeds, our story began with a single cafe. We embarked on a mission to create a unique and unforgettable experience for our customers. Over two years, we refined our craft, listened to our patrons, and became a beloved part of the community.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Expanding to Harrogate</h3>
    <p>With one successful cafe behind us, we were ready to take the next step. That's when we ventured into the charming town of Harrogate. Our second cafe marked a new chapter in our journey, as we shared our passion for exceptional food and service with the people of Harrogate.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>A Historic Landmark: Knareborough Castle</h3>
    <p>But our journey was far from over. Just six months later, we achieved a remarkable milestone by acquiring a location in Knaresborough Castle. This historic site offered a unique opportunity for us to continue our mission in an iconic and unforgettable setting.
       <br>
       <br>
        Today, our story continues to unfold, and we invite you to be a part of it. Join us in these beautiful locations, each with its own unique charm and history, and let us create memorable moments together.</p>
